# Hong Kong Air Quality Analytics

Air pollution is a significant factor affecting millions, even billions of
people living in densely populated areas, especially in Asia.

Reason for me to carry out this little analytics project was simply to educate
myself on the topic and its dynamics, but also to be able to maybe minimize my
personal exposure to pollutants.

Typical ways for individuals to try to minimize pollutant exposure include [2]
* Avoiding outdoor activities when pollution levels are high
* Closing windows and avoiding ventilation
* Running an air purifier indoors
* Wearing a protective mask

More information on pollution can be found in the links in references. [2]

## Introduction to pollutants
Main pollutants that are tracked by Hong Kong government and many independent
trackers are
* Particulate matter: $PM_{2.5}$ and $PM_{10}$ (fine suspended particles (FSP) and 
respirable suspended particles (RSP))
* Ozone ($O_3$)
* Nitride oxides ($NO_2$ and $NOX$)
* Sulphur dioxide (SO_2)
* Carbon Monoxide (CO)
For overall health generally most effect is thought to have by 

## Measuring air quality

### US EPA Air quality index (AQI US)

US environmental protection agency (EPA) has developed an index for tracking
and communicating air quality to the general public. AQI US seems to be the most
widely used air quality measure, and it is the default in most air quality monitoring
apps and websites.

AQI US has split air quality into five distinct regions each of which having a 
qualitative measure i.e. good, moderate etc, and bounds within the pollutant
concentration has to be.

The calculation of AQI US goes as follows
1. Measure particle concentrations
1. Convert individual particle concentrations to AQI US scale
1. Pick the largest AQI US value, which will then be used
as the AQI US value for the measuring station in question

### Hong Kong air quality health index (AQHI)

Hong Kong environmental protection department (EPD) launched a new index
to help communicating air pollution to the general public in 2013. The new AQHI
replaced an older standard, and is still in use today in Hong Kong (2019). [3]

Hong Kong AQHI is based on a Canadian counterpart with the model localised,
which means having recalculated model parameters on data that potentially
better reflect the pollution people in Hong Kong deal with.
