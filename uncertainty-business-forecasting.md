## Uncertainty Modelling for Business Forecasting

Dates: February 2013 – June 2013

Group: 2 people

Context: Innovation project in École Centrale Paris

Innovation project with a goal to develop a business forecasting tool for SMEs. Conducted in the supervision of the deputy director of École Centrale Paris.

The major forecasting algorithm (Holt-Winters exponential smoothing) was written in R language, and a tool with self-made R/Excel integration was implemented for running the algorithm for a balance sheet from Excel.

Below a screenshot of the Excel demonstrator tool built for running the model. On the left we have a drop-down selection for the model in use for each row of the balance sheet. In the right hand side we show the next estimated value, and its confidence limits.
