A study project set up in co-operation with the nuclear waste disposal company Posiva and the technical research center of Finland (VTT).

Our group studied and modelled the dependencies between non-destructive testing methods of nuclear waste disposal canisters. The conclusion was that if the test methods are assumed independent, and the assumption is incorrect, we may underestimate the risk involved. Dependency between the test methods increases the probability of not detecting a critical defect.

In the first figure below we show one copula function with its PDF and CDF (upper panels). The resulting joint distribution with the true marginal distributions is shown in the lower panels (its PDF and CDF).

In the last figure we show how the dependence assumption affected the variable ‘q’, which was the probability of not detecting a defect in a final disposal canister. If the tests were truly independent, they performed better, but if the assumption of independence is incorrect, we may underestimate the true risk.
